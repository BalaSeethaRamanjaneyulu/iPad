Excellent! Now let me generate the final comprehensive report with all the details:

## Your iPad 2 Model A1395: Complete Technical Breakdown
Your iPad 2 model A1395 is a Wi-Fi-only tablet released on March 11, 2011, and manufactured by Foxconn. Despite being approximately 14-15 years old, it contains a wealth of components and sensors that can still be utilized. Here's everything this device is capable of, detailed by component:

### Display Technology & Visuals
Your iPad features a **9.7-inch IPS TFT LCD display** with **1024×768 pixel resolution** at **132 ppi (pixels per inch)**. The display can reach a maximum brightness of **410 cd/m² (nits)**, which was considered bright for 2011 but falls short of modern tablets. The 24-bit color depth produces 16.8 million colors with an oleophobic (fingerprint-resistant) coating and scratch-resistant glass. The 4:3 aspect ratio makes it suitable for reading documents and viewing photos, though web content designed for widescreen will have letterboxing. The display covers approximately 65% of the front surface area due to thick bezels typical of that era.[1][2]

[3][1]

### Processing Power & Performance
At its core sits the **Apple A5 system-on-chip** with a **dual-core 1.0 GHz Cortex-A9 CPU** and **PowerVR SGX543MP2 dual-core GPU running at 200 MHz**. With only **512 MB of LPDDR2 RAM**, multitasking is severely limited. The 32 KB instruction and data caches plus 1 MB L2 cache help with performance, but this processor struggles with modern apps. The 32-bit architecture means you cannot run 64-bit applications, limiting your to apps designed before the iOS 64-bit transition. This device can handle basic web browsing, media playback, and older games, but intensive applications will cause significant slowdowns or crashes.[1]

[4][1]

### Camera Capabilities
**Rear Camera**: The 0.7 MP rear camera captures images at 960×720 pixels with a fixed focus and no flash. It can record HD video at 720p (1280×720 pixels) at 30 fps with audio, producing reasonable video quality for its era. The 5x digital zoom is purely interpolative and degrades quality. This camera is adequate for scanning documents, taking reference photos, or creating basic video content.[3][1]

**Front Camera**: The 0.3 MP front-facing VGA (640×480) camera is designed for FaceTime video calls. While not high resolution, it functions well for video calling with other Apple devices on the same network.[1]

[3][1]

### Sensor Suite & Navigation
Your iPad includes an impressive array of sensors for 2011:[1][3]

- **Digital Compass/Magnetometer**: Located in the top-right corner, it detects magnetic fields within ±2 gauss range with sensitivity below 100 microgauss. This enables accurate directional navigation when paired with Maps app, allowing you to orient the map to your direction of travel while hiking or navigating outdoors.

- **3-Axis Accelerometer**: Detects motion in three dimensions, enabling screen auto-rotation, motion-based games, and fitness tracking apps.

- **3-Axis Gyroscope**: Measures rotation and angular velocity, providing precise orientation data essential for gaming and advanced navigation.

- **Ambient Light Sensor**: Automatically adjusts screen brightness based on surrounding lighting conditions, extending battery life significantly.

- **Proximity Sensor**: Disables the screen during FaceTime calls to prevent accidental touches.

Notably, **the Wi-Fi model has no GPS** – location services rely entirely on Wi-Fi triangulation, which is less accurate and slower than GPS but still functional for general navigation.

[5][1]

### Audio System in Detail
The Cirrus Logic CS42L63 audio controller delivers **frequency response from 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz** (covering the full human hearing spectrum). The **24-bit audio at 48 kHz** provides good quality for playback. However, both the microphone and speaker are **mono**, limiting stereo recording and playback to headphone jack output.[3]

Supported formats include HE-AAC, AAC (8-320 Kbps), MP3, Apple Lossless, AIFF, and WAV files. The 3.5mm headphone jack allows connection to external speakers and quality headphones, bypassing the limited mono speaker. The built-in speaker is adequate for notifications but produces mono audio only with limited bass response.

[3]

### Memory & Storage Configuration
Your 32GB model provides **512 MB RAM** for active applications and **approximately 15GB of usable storage** after the operating system takes its share. With no expandable storage, you're limited to local content. This storage can hold approximately:[1]
- 300-500 photos (high-resolution 4MB each)
- 100-200 songs in standard quality
- 8-15 full-length HD movies
- Several hundred documents and apps[6][7]

The lack of RAM severely restricts the number of apps you can have open simultaneously; typically only 2-3 apps can reasonably run at once before the system becomes sluggish.
### Connectivity Specifications
**Wi-Fi**: 802.11a/b/g/n dual-band wireless with theoretical speeds up to 150+ Mbps on 802.11n. Real-world speeds on this aged device are typically 10-20 Mbps due to hardware limitations. The internal antenna is integrated into the aluminum frame.[3]

**Bluetooth 2.1 + EDR**: Legacy Bluetooth technology supporting only A2DP audio profile. It cannot connect to modern Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) devices, severely limiting compatibility with contemporary wireless accessories.

**No Cellular**: This Wi-Fi-only model has no 3G, 4G, 5G, or LTE connectivity—a significant limitation in 2024-2026 when mobile networks increasingly deprecate older technologies.

**USB 2.0**: The proprietary 30-pin dock connector provides USB 2.0 data transfer (480 Mbps theoretical, ~30-40 Mbps practical) for charging and syncing with iTunes/computers.

[3]

### Power & Battery Characteristics
The **6,580 mAh lithium-polymer battery** stores **25 Wh of energy**, providing approximately **10 hours of continuous use** for web browsing, video, or music playback according to Apple's original specifications. However, after 14+ years in 2025, **battery health is severely degraded**. Lithium-polymer batteries lose 10-15% capacity per year even with infrequent use, meaning your battery likely retains only 10-20% of original capacity. The battery is **non-removable**, making replacement difficult without professional help.[3]

⚠️ **Critical Warning**: Old lithium-polymer batteries can become safety hazards if overcharged, overheated, or physically damaged. If your iPad is warm to the touch or the back feels puffy/swollen, **do not use it**. Consider battery replacement or responsible recycling.[3]
