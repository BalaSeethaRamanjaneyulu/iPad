### About GPS specifically (your question)

| Item | A1395 (Wi‑Fi) behaviour |
|---|---|
| GPS chip | Not present – there is **no** hardware GPS in A1395 [2][3] |
| How location works | Uses Wi‑Fi network database + compass; needs Wi‑Fi around you to estimate position [3] |
| What this means | Can show approximate location in Maps in cities, but cannot do true offline turn‑by‑turn GPS navigation like a phone or the Wi‑Fi+3G iPad 2 [3] |

If you want, the next step can be a second table only for “practical uses” per component (camera, sensors, Wi‑Fi, etc.) based on what you plan to build.
